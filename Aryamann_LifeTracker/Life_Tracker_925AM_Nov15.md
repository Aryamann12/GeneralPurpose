I am currently struggling to balance out my time between AI and Finance Projects - I want to add more clarity into my work where and how much time I am putting into each domain  |

### Focus Areas:
- **Primary Focus:** Finance Billing Dashboard work. Prioritize AI/RAG tasks for higher engagement.
- **North Star Project:** Dedicate time to learning LangChain/LangGraph for the Graph Orchestration Platform.
- **Side Project:** Progress on AI Screening Agent as per plan.
- **Mindset Management:** Stay calm under friction with colleagues; do not carry emotional disruptions.

### Key Office People
- **Pramod Shokeen** – Point person for the Billing Dashboard; I am currently most fearful of him because he has scolded me harshly in the past for not completing work on time, but he also pushes me to be more accountable and structured.
- **Surendra Salke** – Senior Director, AI; I feel a bit of fear and pressure here as well because he is senior and I want to prove myself on CampusGrid and the Agent Platform, but his vision for AI motivates me.
- **Antony Joseph** – Associate Director, Finance and my manager; the sweetest of all three, very supportive and understanding, giving me the most emotional safety while I learn to balance AI and Finance work.
